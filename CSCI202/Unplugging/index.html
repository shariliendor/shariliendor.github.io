        <h1>My Experience Unplugging for a day</h1>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
            I unplugged from technology on Saturday. I gave my phone to one of my housemates, 
            but at one point I had to take it back from him to text my girlfriend that I couldn’t 
            talk to her. I don’t know how I managed to forget that. I also had to do a lot of 
            homework in advance because I’ve been swamped this quarter, so that was annoying.
        </p>

        <h2>Going Out</h2>
        <p>
            I went for a hike in the arb in the afternoon and when I got to the bus stop I realized 
            that if I hadn’t brought my watch I wouldn’t know what time it was. It’s interesting 
            how we depend on our phones for things as simple as that. Anyway though, I went hiking 
            and it was really cold and I used the maps on the trail to navigate, which wasn’t hard 
            cause I take walks there often. I did explore a little there and I found some trails I’d 
            never been on before. It seems like it’s frosty all the time there.
        </p>

        <h2>Connecting with the World</h2>
        <p>
            Usually I use my bluetooth earbuds to listen to audiobooks or call my girlfriend when I’m 
            walking but I obviously couldn’t do that this time. It was kinda nice to hear the sounds 
            of the forest and be alone with my thoughts. Maybe I should do that more often. I remember 
            reaching into my pocket for my phone to take a picture. Obviously it wasn’t there. 
        </p>

        <h2>Back Home</h2>
        <p>
            When I got home instead of watching TV or playing video games (I’ve been really getting into 
            Tactical Breach Wizards lately), I folded an origami lion fish and built a dragonfly from a 
            metal earth kit.

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
            Overall, I think it was a good experience. In terms of opting out of smart phones, definitely 
            not sustainable, especially in a long distance relationship and as a college student. I'd 
            like to do it again sometime though. It was kinda nice, so it could be a once in a while thing.
