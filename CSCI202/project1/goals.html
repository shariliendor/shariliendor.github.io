    <p>
        My ultimate goal in life is to be happy. I don't 
        particularly care how, but it seems like it's got a lot
        to do with my girlfriend.

        As for the more immediate future though, I'm trying to 
        get through college as fast as possible so I can save money
        and move in with Brooke. Also I'd like to finish all those projects.
